# ![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=spring) SoftUni Spring Data course

## 🧾Description 
In the "Spring Data" course, we will examine in detail the work with a contemporary ORM technology: Hibernate, which is practically the standard for ORM in Java applications. Hibernate allows mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model (Java classes) through the "database first" and "code first" approaches and provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying the database and performing CRUD operations from Java. Spring Data, in turn, further builds upon the standard API and provides an additional level of abstraction as well as an easy way to handle data from the database. The course will demonstrate established practices in building a database layer for complex systems in Java applications through embedded implementations of the Repository pattern and the use of the Service Layer, as well as import and export to various data formats (JSON, XML).
